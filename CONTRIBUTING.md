- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

### Reporting Process
1. Contact the project maintainers at `security@knowledgeaggregator.com`
2. Provide detailed information about the incident
3. Expect an acknowledgment within 24 hours
4. The team will review and investigate the report
5. Appropriate action will be taken based on findings

### Enforcement Guidelines
1. First Violation: Warning with explanation
2. Second Violation: Temporary ban (1 month)
3. Third Violation: Permanent ban
4. Severe Violations: Immediate permanent ban

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes v1.28+
- Docker v24+
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20 LTS
- Vector database (Pinecone Enterprise)
- Neo4j 5+ Enterprise
- Redis 7.0+

### Local Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/org/knowledge-aggregator
cd knowledge-aggregator

# Install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Configure local Kubernetes cluster
kubectl apply -f k8s/local/
```

### Vector Database Initialization
```bash
# Initialize Pinecone indexes
python scripts/init_vector_db.py \
  --dimension 384 \
  --metric cosine \
  --pods 2
```

### Security Configuration
```bash
# Generate development certificates
./scripts/gen_certs.sh

# Configure RBAC
kubectl apply -f k8s/rbac/

# Initialize vault secrets
vault operator init
```

## Development Workflow

### GitOps Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement changes
4. Submit pull request
5. ArgoCD handles deployment

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `security/*`: Security updates

### Commit Message Convention
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### Pull Request Process
1. Update documentation
2. Add/update tests
3. Ensure CI passes
4. Get two approvals
5. Squash and merge

## Testing Guidelines

### Required Tests
- Unit Tests
  ```python
  def test_vector_similarity():
      # Test vector operations
      assert calculate_similarity(vec1, vec2) > 0.8
  ```

- Integration Tests
  ```python
  def test_knowledge_graph_generation():
      # Test end-to-end graph creation
      graph = generate_knowledge_graph(topic)
      assert len(graph.nodes) >= 10
  ```

- Performance Tests
  ```bash
  # Run benchmarks
  python -m pytest tests/performance/ \
    --benchmark-only \
    --benchmark-autosave
  ```

### Security Testing
- SAST with SonarQube
- DAST with OWASP ZAP
- Dependency scanning
- Container scanning with Trivy

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Standards
```typescript
// Use interfaces for type definitions
interface KnowledgeNode {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  properties: Record<string, unknown>;
  relevanceScore: number;
}

// Use enums for fixed values
enum ContentType {
  Article = 'article',
  Video = 'video',
  Podcast = 'podcast'
}
```

### Python Standards
```python
# Type hints required
def process_vector(
    embedding: np.ndarray,
    threshold: float = 0.8
) -> List[float]:
    """
    Process vector embeddings.
    
    Args:
        embedding: Input vector
        threshold: Similarity threshold
        
    Returns:
        Processed vector values
    """
    return [x for x in embedding if x > threshold]
```

## Security Guidelines

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- Implement input validation
- Use parameterized queries
- Enable CSRF protection
- Configure security headers
- Implement rate limiting

### Data Privacy
```typescript
// Example of data sanitization
function sanitizeUserInput(input: string): string {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: []
  });
}
```

### Access Control
- Implement RBAC
- Use JWT with short expiration
- Enable MFA for admin access
- Audit all access attempts

## Release Process

### Version Control
Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Change log updated
- [ ] Version bumped
- [ ] Release notes prepared

### Deployment Process
1. Tag release in GitHub
2. ArgoCD detects new tag
3. Blue/green deployment starts
4. Canary testing (10% traffic)
5. Full rollout if successful

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Immediate rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/service-name

# Revert to specific version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/service-name --to-revision=2
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- Monitor error rates
- Check performance metrics
- Verify data consistency
- Validate security controls
