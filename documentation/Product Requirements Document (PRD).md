# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the AI-powered knowledge aggregation and curation system. It serves as the primary reference for technical teams, stakeholders, and project managers involved in the development process. The document details functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, and implementation specifications required to build a solution that transforms fragmented learning resources into structured, digestible knowledge.

## 1.2 Scope

The system will be a web-based platform that revolutionizes topic-based learning through intelligent content aggregation and organization. The core functionalities include:

- Automated discovery and ranking of high-quality multimedia content from diverse sources

  \- Perform comprehensive initial research upon receiving a new topic.

  \- Query APIs (Spotify, YouTube, Google Books, ArXiv, etc.) and scrape trusted sources for exhaustive coverage.

  \- Prioritize quality over speed by dedicating substantial processing time to ensure all relevant sources are considered before filtering.

  \- Cache results to avoid repeated API calls, enabling faster subsequent runs for the same topic.    
    
  Advanced data management using vector databases for semantic search capabilities

- ```
  - During the initial setup, allow extended processing time to:  
    - Rank content based on relevance, quality, and diversity.  
    - Apply multiple filtering passes to refine the dataset iteratively, ensuring minimal noise.  
    - Use advanced clustering techniques to organize data into well-defined subtopics.  
  - Prioritize recall (finding all relevant information) over precision initially, followed by filtering to achieve optimal balance.  
  ```

- AI-powered knowledge organization and meta-modeling

- Interactive knowledge graph visualization

- Customizable multimedia output generation in structured formats

- - For the initial topic report, prioritize comprehensive research and insight generation over speed.

  \- Allow the system to perform multiple iterations on summary drafts, ensuring the most relevant, well-organized insights are presented.

  \- Subsequent updates or refreshes for the same topic should emphasize speed by leveraging pre-cached and previously processed data.

Key benefits:

- Reduces research time from hours/days to minutes
- Provides comprehensive topic coverage across multiple content types
- Ensures quality through algorithmic content ranking and filtering
- Delivers personalized learning experiences
- Enables efficient knowledge sharing for both individuals and organizations

  ```
  Initial Research Mode:
  - When given a new topic, the tool enters an in-depth research mode:  
    - Allocates substantial resources to gather, analyze, and organize all possible information.  
    - Runs multiple processing layers to evaluate content quality, eliminate redundancies, and generate meaningful relationships.  
    - Flags gaps in available data and suggests alternative searches or related topics if necessary.  
  - Include a progress indicator (e.g., "Research in Progress: 75% complete") to manage user expectations for the extended processing time.  
  - Output a summary of research decisions and criteria used for content selection to enhance transparency and trust.  
  ```

The system will support:

- Individual knowledge seekers (students, professionals, researchers)
- Corporate teams requiring rapid knowledge acquisition
- Content creators and subject matter experts
- Educational institutions and research organizations

Out of scope:

- Original content creation
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Social networking features
