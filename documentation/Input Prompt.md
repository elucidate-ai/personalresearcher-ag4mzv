WHY - Vision & Purpose

Purpose & Users
	•	Primary Problem Solved: Rapid learning of new topics is hampered by fragmented and overwhelming sources. Traditional methods require excessive time and effort to identify high-quality resources and understand them in depth.
	•	Target Users:
	•	Knowledge seekers, including students, professionals, researchers, and hobbyists exploring complex or niche topics.
	•	Corporations needing fast, high-quality topic briefs for internal learning or market research.
	•	Value Proposition:
	•	An AI-powered tool that aggregates, organizes, and curates high-quality multimedia content, delivering insights in a structured, easy-to-digest format.
	•	Reduces manual research time from hours or days to minutes, enabling users to focus on applying the knowledge rather than gathering it.

WHAT - Core Requirements

Functional Requirements

Core Features
	1.	Content Discovery & Aggregation:
	•	Identify and rank top researchers, influencers, and resources using metrics such as publication impact, citation counts, social engagement, and collaboration networks.
	•	Aggregate diverse content types:
	•	Open sources: Articles, podcasts, YouTube videos.
	•	Closed sources: Books and paywalled articles (summarized or accessed via partnerships).
	2.	Data Management & Filtering:
	•	Store relevant data in a vector database for semantic search capabilities.
	•	Apply NLP models to:
	•	Filter out irrelevant or low-quality information.
	•	Cluster similar data and remove redundancies.
	•	Auto-tag content with meta-data such as topics, keywords, and contributors.
	3.	Knowledge Organization:
	•	Use a meta-model to:
	•	Summarize key insights and connections across resources.
	•	Generate structured, logical groupings for topics.
	•	Create interactive knowledge graphs to visualize relationships between concepts, resources, and contributors.
	4.	Output Generation:
	•	Produce multimedia documents in platforms like Notion, including:
	•	A concise overview of the topic.
	•	Embedded summaries, video snippets (1-minute max), and curated links.
	•	Suggested learning paths tailored to user preferences.

User Capabilities
	•	Input topic preferences (e.g., depth, preferred content type).
	•	Search interactively for sub-topics or related concepts.
	•	Export personalized summaries and reports for offline use.

HOW - Planning & Implementation

Technical Implementation
	1.	Content Aggregation Workflow:
	•	Query APIs (Spotify, YouTube, Google Books, etc.) daily for updated content.
	•	Scrape and preprocess text from identified sources.
	•	Rank content based on relevance using semantic search and network strength algorithms.
	2.	Data Management:
	•	Use Pinecone or Weaviate for semantic vector database storage.
	•	Apply AI-based clustering for similar data points.
	•	Use tags for organizing content by category, relevance, and theme.
	3.	Knowledge Graph Creation:
	•	Extract entities (concepts, people, keywords) and relationships from text.
	•	Visualize nodes and edges interactively using libraries like D3.js or Cytoscape.
	4.	Multimedia Output Generation:
	•	Structure outputs for platforms like Notion or Markdown with:
	•	Overview section.
	•	Video snippets and linked podcasts.
	•	Topic recommendations and learning paths.

User Experience (UX)
	•	Intuitive search interface with autocomplete for topics.
	•	Interactive knowledge graphs with zoom, pan, and node details.
	•	Customizable preferences for learning (e.g., content type, depth).
	•	Real-time notifications for significant updates or new insights.

Business Requirements
	•	Monetization:
	•	Freemium model: Basic summaries for free; premium features (video snippets, advanced aggregation) as paid services.
	•	Corporate licensing for team knowledge-sharing solutions.
	•	Partnerships: Collaborate with content providers for premium access.

Implementation Priorities
	•	High: Aggregation engine, filtering system, vector database.
	•	Medium: Knowledge graph visualization.
	•	Low: Real-time notifications.

Key Considerations
	1.	Metrics for Success:
	•	Aggregation accuracy: 90% relevance threshold.
	•	Summary generation speed: Under 5 seconds per content item.
	•	Knowledge graph complexity: Minimum 10 connections per topic.
	2.	Edge Cases:
	•	Insufficient data: Suggest adjacent topics or broader searches.
	•	Conflicting information: Highlight discrepancies with confidence scores.
	3.	Testing Criteria:
	•	Test with diverse topics (e.g., “Decentralized AI,” “Quantum Computing”) for coverage.
	•	Validate summaries against domain expert reviews.
	•	Assess user satisfaction through feedback on usability and outputs.
