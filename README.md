An enterprise-grade AI-powered knowledge curation platform that transforms scattered information into structured, digestible knowledge through automated content discovery, intelligent organization, and personalized output generation.

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Knowledge Aggregation System addresses the critical challenge of fragmented and overwhelming learning resources by providing an intelligent platform that reduces research time from hours to minutes. The system leverages advanced AI technologies including:

- Vector databases for semantic search
- Knowledge graphs for relationship mapping
- Multi-source content aggregation
- Intelligent content ranking and filtering

### Key Features

- **Content Discovery Engine**
  - Multi-source content aggregation
  - Quality assessment and ranking
  - Resource categorization
  - 90% relevance threshold

- **Vector Database Management**
  - Semantic search capabilities
  - Content clustering
  - Redundancy elimination
  - Sub-second query performance

- **Knowledge Organization Module**
  - Topic relationship mapping
  - Interactive knowledge graphs
  - Meta-model based structuring
  - Minimum 10 connections per topic

- **Output Generation Service**
  - Multimedia document creation
  - Personalized learning paths
  - Multiple export formats
  - Enterprise system integration
